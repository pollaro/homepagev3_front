      <p>I've been working in web development for about 4 years. Before that, I worked in academia doing MRI research. That's where I learned Python and got the programming bug.</p>

      <p>I have experience with back and front end development. Mostly Python on the back, and some Node. On the front end, I've used the three major JavaScript frameworks (Angular, React, Vue)</p>
